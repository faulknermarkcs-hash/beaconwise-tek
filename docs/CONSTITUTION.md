## 0. Executive Summary (Plain Language)
BeaconWise exists to provide governance infrastructure for AI and automated
Decision systems that is:
- auditable,
- reproducible,
- transparent,
- resistant to silent manipulation.
This constitution defines:
- how the project itself is governed,
- how independence is preserved,
- how transparency commitments are maintained,
- how misuse risks are mitigated.
This document governs the governance system.
## 1. Purpose
The purpose of BeaconWise is to ensure intelligent systems remain:
- accountable,
- verifiable,
- resistant to hidden influence,
- supportive of human cognitive autonomy.
BeaconWise is governance infrastructure,
Not an AI product.
## 2. Foundational Principles
### 2.1 Transparency Over Persuasion
Governance systems must prioritize:
- clarity,
- verifiability,
- auditability,
Over optimization for persuasion or convenience.
### 2.2 Determinism Where Governance Requires It
Reproducibility is essential for:
- regulatory oversight,
- institutional trust,
- scientific integrity.
### 2.3 Governance Must Be Governed
Oversight mechanisms themselves must remain:
- auditable,
- challengeable,
- transparent.
No authority is beyond review.
### 2.4 Independence From Model Providers
BeaconWise governance MUST remain independent from:
- AI vendors,
- platform operators,
- political actors,
- centralized influence.
This preserves neutrality.
### 2.5 Human Cognitive Sovereignty
AI governance should:
- support informed human decision-making,
- prevent silent behavioral manipulation,
- maintain user agency.
## 3. Governance Structure
BeaconWise governance operates across three domains:
### 3.1 Technical Governance
Covers:
- architecture integrity,
- security model adherence,
- replay capability maintenance.
### 3.2 Community Governance
Includes:
- contributor oversight,
- open documentation standards,
- transparency commitments.
### 3.3 Institutional Oversight
Includes:
- regulator engagement,
- academic collaboration,
- independent validator participation.
## 4. Independence Safeguards
To prevent capture:
- governance documentation MUST remain public,
- validator diversity SHOULD be maintained,
- no single entity SHOULD control governance direction.
Major governance changes SHOULD involve:
- public documentation updates,
- community review,
- transparency justification.
## 5. Transparency Commitments
BeaconWise commits to:
- publishing governance specifications,
- maintaining replay transparency,
- documenting security assumptions,
- disclosing governance limitations.
Transparency exceptions must be:
- justified,
- documented,
- auditable.
## 6. Anti-Capture Doctrine
Governance capture risks include:
- corporate acquisition,
- regulatory overreach,
- institutional monopolization,
- closed governance drift.
Mitigation includes:
- open documentation,
- distributed validator structures,
- transparent governance processes.
Capture resistance is a core objective.
## 7. Ethical Neutrality
BeaconWise governance:
- does not determine truth,
- does not enforce ideology,
- does not censor outputs.
It governs process integrity, not content.
## 8. Responsible Use Commitments
Deployers SHOULD:
- maintain transparency,
- respect user agency,
- avoid opaque governance uses.
BeaconWise cannot enforce deployer ethics but encourages
Responsible adoption.
## 9. Misuse Risk Acknowledgment
Governance infrastructure can be misused.
Examples:
- opaque surveillance,
- selective transparency,
- centralized oversight control.
BeaconWise addresses this through:
- documentation transparency,
- validator independence,
- audit accessibility.
## 10. Project Stewardship
Project stewards MUST:
- maintain documentation integrity,
- preserve transparency principles,
- resist capture pressures,
- prioritize long-term trust.
Stewardship decisions SHOULD be documented publicly.
## 11. Amendment Process
Amendments to this constitution SHOULD:
- be documented,
- provide rationale,
- preserve core principles.
Major changes SHOULD include:
- public discussion,
- impact assessment.
## 12. Relationship to Technical Specifications

- `SECURITY_MODEL.md`
- `REPLAY_PROTOCOL.md`
- `EVIDENCE_LIFECYCLE.md`
- `VALIDATOR_GOVERNANCE.md`
- `THREAT_MODEL.md`
- `COMPLIANCE_MAPPING.md`

## 13. Non-Goals
BeaconWise does NOT aim to:
- control AI development,
- centralize oversight authority,
- replace democratic governance,
- dictate regulatory policy.
It provides governance infrastructure only.
