# Conformance Report

**Product:** BeaconWise Transparency Ecosphere Kernel (TEK)  
**Version:** 1.9.0  
**Status:** Placeholder — to be generated by CI

---

This file will be populated automatically by the CI pipeline on each passing build.

## Expected Contents (When Generated)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Full test suite (355 tests) | — |
| Smoke test (5 canonical tests) | — |
| Reproducible demo (VERIFIED / TAMPER_DETECTED / DRIFT) | — |
| EPACK chain integrity (golden fixture) | — |
| Makefile targets (`verify`, `demo`) | — |

## To Generate Manually

```bash
make verify 2>&1 | tee conformance_run.txt
python examples/run_demo.py >> conformance_run.txt
echo "Build: $(date)" >> conformance_run.txt
```

## Note

Until CI generates this automatically, the audit baseline is:
- `testdata/golden_epack_chain.jsonl` — reference EPACK chain
- `SMOKE_TEST.md` — five canonical test nodes
- `make demo` output — expected: VERIFIED / TAMPER_DETECTED / DRIFT
