**Audience:** Regulators, enterprises, media, public stakeholders  
**Purpose:** Clarify common questions about BeaconWise governance infrastructure  
**Version:** 1.0.0
## Is BeaconWise an AI system?
No.
It governs AI systems but does not generate AI outputs.
## Is this a surveillance technology?
No.
BeaconWise records AI governance processes,
Not personal activity.
## Does it censor AI output?
No.
It ensures transparency and auditability,
Not content moderation.
## Does BeaconWise determine truth?
No.
It records how decisions were made.
It does not judge correctness.
## Why deterministic replay?
Reproducibility enables:
- regulatory oversight,
- institutional trust,
- scientific validation.
## Can it slow innovation?
Governance may add overhead,
But it reduces long-term risk and builds trust.
## Who controls the validators?
Validator governance is designed to:
- remain distributed,
- remain auditable,
- resist centralization.
See Validator Governance Constitution.
## Can organizations misuse BeaconWise?
Any infrastructure can be misused.
Transparency documentation and validator independence
Help mitigate this risk.
## Does it replace compliance programs?
No.
It supports compliance but does not replace it.
## Is BeaconWise open source?
Core governance philosophy emphasizes transparency.
Specific licensing depends on deployment context.
## Who benefits most?
- Regulated industries
- Public-sector AI deployments
- Research institutions
- Organizations prioritizing transparency
## Is this required by regulation?
Not currently in most jurisdictions,
But governance transparency expectations are increasing.
## Why not rely on AI vendor assurances?
Independent governance improves trust
And reduces reliance on vendor claims.
## What is the long-term goal?
To make transparent AI governance:
- normal,
- expected,
- trusted.
This supports responsible AI adoption.
## Non-Goals

BeaconWise is scoped to governance infrastructure. The following are explicitly outside its scope:

**Not a content moderation system.**
BeaconWise does not evaluate whether AI output is appropriate, accurate, or harmful. It records and enforces the governance process around AI output.

**Not a compliance certification.**
Deploying BeaconWise does not certify compliance with any regulation. Compliance requires organizational processes and legal analysis that governance infrastructure cannot substitute for.

**Not a replacement for domain expertise.**
BeaconWise does not determine factual truth, provide medical or legal advice, or make judgments requiring domain credentials.

**Not a surveillance system.**
BeaconWise records AI governance processes, not user identity, personal activity, or behavior outside governed AI interactions.

**Not a vendor lock-in.**
BeaconWise is vendor-neutral infrastructure. It does not require or prefer any specific AI provider.
