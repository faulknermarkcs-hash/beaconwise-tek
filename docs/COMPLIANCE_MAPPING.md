## 0. Executive Summary (Plain Language)
BeaconWise provides governance infrastructure designed to improve:
- transparency,
- auditability,
- reproducibility,
- oversight accountability,
For AI-driven and automated decision systems.
This document explains how BeaconWise aligns with:
- emerging AI governance frameworks,
- enterprise audit expectations,
- reproducibility standards.
BeaconWise does NOT claim automatic regulatory compliance.
Instead, it provides infrastructure that:
- supports compliance activities,
- enables oversight,
- improves audit readiness.
Compliance remains the responsibility of system deployers.
## 1. Scope
This specification maps BeaconWise governance capabilities to:
- AI governance frameworks,
- enterprise risk management practices,
- regulatory transparency expectations.
It does not:
- interpret law,
- provide legal advice,
- guarantee regulatory approval.
## 2. Mapping Philosophy
The mapping follows three principles:
1. Capability alignment, not legal claims  
2. Transparency over marketing language  
3. Cross-framework consistency.
BeaconWise is infrastructure that enables compliance, not compliance itself.
## 3. NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)
BeaconWise strongly aligns with the four NIST AI RMF functions.
### 3.1 Govern
Relevant BeaconWise features:
- validator governance constitution,
- audit chain integrity,
- challenger oversight,
- governance transparency documentation.
Contribution:
- improves accountability structures,
- supports internal governance review.
### 3.2 Map
Relevant features:
- evidence lifecycle tracking,
- replayable decision history,
- threat modeling.
Contribution:
- improved risk identification,
- traceable system behavior.
### 3.3 Measure
Relevant features:
- deterministic replay,
- validator consensus outputs,
- audit persistence.
Contribution:
- reproducible evaluation,
- quantifiable oversight data.
### 3.4 Manage
Relevant features:
- governance audit continuity,
- incident recording,
- validator rotation policies.
Contribution:
Operational risk response support.
## 4. EU AI Act Alignment (Conceptual)
BeaconWise supports requirements commonly associated with:
- high-risk AI transparency,
- traceability expectations,
- auditability requirements.
Relevant capabilities:
- deterministic replay protocol,
- evidence lifecycle governance,
- validator oversight,
- tamper-evident records.
BeaconWise does not replace regulatory obligations.
## 5. Enterprise Audit Framework Alignment
### 5.1 SOC2-Type Concepts
Relevant areas:
- audit trail integrity,
- change traceability,
- evidence retention,
- incident documentation.
BeaconWise enhances:
- traceable AI operations,
- governance documentation.
### 5.2 Model Risk Management (Financial Sector)
Relevant capabilities:
- replayable decisions,
- evidence persistence,
- validator oversight.
Contribution:
- reproducibility of model-driven decisions,
- improved model governance transparency.
## 6. Scientific Reproducibility Alignment
BeaconWise supports:
- reproducible research,
- deterministic replay,
- evidence provenance tracking.
This is relevant for:
- academic AI research,
- public sector analytics,
- regulated scientific environments.
## 7. Transparency and Accountability Standards
BeaconWise infrastructure supports:
- explainability through audit trails,
- accountability through validator governance,
- transparency through replayability.
It does not enforce explanation quality but enables verification.
## 8. Privacy and Data Protection Interaction
BeaconWise supports privacy compliance by:
- enabling auditable redaction,
- preserving evidence continuity,
- documenting transformations.
Deployers remain responsible for:
- data protection compliance,
- jurisdictional privacy laws.
## 9. Regulatory Sandbox Compatibility
BeaconWise is suitable for:
- regulatory experimentation,
- pilot transparency programs,
- AI governance research.
Because it provides:
- reproducible outputs,
- audit continuity,
- explicit governance records.
## 10. Deployment Classification Guidance
BeaconWise deployments may support:
- internal enterprise governance,
- regulator-supervised environments,
- open transparency infrastructures,
- hybrid governance ecosystems.
Classification depends on deployer context.
## 11. Residual Compliance Risks
BeaconWise cannot address:
- organizational policy failures,
- infrastructure security lapses,
- legal interpretation issues,
- data governance deficiencies.
These remain external responsibilities.
## 12. Documentation Recommendations
Organizations deploying BeaconWise SHOULD maintain:
- governance configuration records,
- validator independence documentation,
- replay certification results,
- evidence lifecycle policies.
These strengthen compliance posture.
## 13. Conformance Indicators
Indicators of strong governance alignment include:
- consistent deterministic replay success,
- documented validator independence,
- maintained evidence retention,
- transparent incident reporting.
## 14. Relationship to Other Specifications
This document should be read alongside:
- `SECURITY_MODEL.md`
- `THREAT_MODEL.md`
- `REPLAY_PROTOCOL.md`
- `EVIDENCE_LIFECYCLE.md`
- `VALIDATOR_GOVERNANCE.md`
Together they define BeaconWise governance infrastructure.
## 15. Future Alignment Areas
Potential future mappings include:
- ISO AI governance standards,
- national AI regulatory frameworks,
- sector-specific compliance models.
BeaconWise is designed for adaptability.
## 16. Non-Goals
This document does NOT:
- provide legal certification,
- guarantee regulatory acceptance,
- replace legal counsel,
- define compliance outcomes.
It supports governance capability understanding.
