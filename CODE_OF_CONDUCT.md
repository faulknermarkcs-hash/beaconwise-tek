# Code of Conduct

**Project:** BeaconWise Transparency Ecosphere Kernel (TEK)  
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Applies to:** All project spaces

---

## Our Commitment

BeaconWise exists to make AI governance infrastructure auditable, reproducible, and resistant to hidden influence. We hold the project community to the same standard: transparent, accountable, and resistant to manipulation.

Contributors, maintainers, and participants in this project commit to making participation a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

- Communicate with directness and good faith
- Respect that governance infrastructure attracts people with varied backgrounds — academic researchers, enterprise compliance teams, independent security researchers — treat all with equal seriousness
- Give and receive critique of ideas without making it personal
- Acknowledge mistakes and correct course without defensiveness
- Prioritize the integrity of the project over individual credit
- Report security vulnerabilities through the process in `SECURITY.md`, not in public issue threads

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, intimidation, or sustained hostile behavior toward any participant
- Personal attacks or ad hominem responses to technical disagreement
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Attempting to use governance infrastructure discussions as a vector for misinformation or regulatory manipulation
- Sustained disruption of community discussions
- Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, the project wiki, and any official communication channels. It also applies when an individual is representing the project publicly — at conferences, in published work, or in communications with regulators, enterprises, or the press.

---

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers via the contact in `SECURITY.md`. All reports will be reviewed promptly and treated with confidentiality.

Maintainers may take corrective action including temporary or permanent removal from project spaces in response to conduct they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful. Maintainers who do not enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith are themselves subject to the same process.
